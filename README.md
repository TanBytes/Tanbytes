## Introduction
Applied Education through Lucid Simulation, Interactive games & Quizzes.

## Business Plan
Our business plan outlines the goals, strategies, and vision for TanBytes. It provides an overview of our target market, competitive analysis, and revenue model.

## Problem to Solve
1. Limited visualization and complexity: Abstract and intricate concepts are often difficult to represent and explain effectively.

2. Lack of real-world context: Students struggle to connect theoretical knowledge to practical applications.

3. Insufficient experimentation: There's often little opportunity for hands-on exploration of concepts.

4. Rigid learning pace: Students have limited chances to revisit and reinforce difficult concepts at their own speed.

5. Missed collaborative opportunities: The conventional arrangement may not fully leverage the potential for exploration and discovery between teachers and students.

6. Lack of immediate feedback: Students often have to wait for assignments to be graded to know if they've understood a concept correctly.

## Value Proposition
- Problem Solving Skills
- Controlled environments for experimentation
